        <!--FIRST TITLE-->
<h3>Many-To-One:</h3>

<p id="par1">Many-to-one model maps many user level threads to one Kernel-level thread. Thread 
    management is done in user space by the thread library.<span style="color: red"> When thread makes a blocking 
    system call, the entire process will be blocked</span>. Only one thread can access the Kernel at 
    a time, so multiple threads are unable to run in parallel on multiprocessors.
    If the user-level thread libraries are implemented in the operating system in such a way 
    that the system does not support them, then the Kernel threads use the many-to-one 
    relationship modes
    </p>

        <!--SECOND TITLE-->
  <h3>One-To-One:</h3>

  <p id="par2">There is one-to-one relationship of user-level thread to the kernel-level thread. This model 
    provides more concurrency than the many-to-one model. <span style="color: red;"> also allows another thread to 
    run when a thread makes a blocking system call</span>. It supports multiple threads to execute 
    in parallel on microprocessors.
    Disadvantage of this model is that creating user thread requires the corresponding Kernel 
    thread. OS/2, windows NT and windows 2000 use one to one relationship model
